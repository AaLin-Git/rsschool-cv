### **About Myself**

Some time ago I decided to reshape my life by learning to code. It turned out to be much easier and clearer than I thought. Now I can't imagine a day without coding. I learn and improve my knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React. I learn quickly, solve tasks and pay attention to details.
